      "In furniture filling, microfiber refers to a synthetic fabric made from extremely fine polyester fibers.  These fibers are much thinner than a human hair, resulting in a material that's incredibly soft, plush, and resilient.  When used as a furniture filling, microfiber provides several advantages:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Softness and Comfort:** Its fine fibers create a luxurious, comfortable feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Durability:**  Microfiber is relatively strong and resistant to wear and tear, making it a long-lasting filling material.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Resilience:** It retains its shape and plumpness well over time, unlike some other filling materials that can flatten easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Hypoallergenic:** Microfiber is often promoted as hypoallergenic because it doesn't readily harbor dust mites or other allergens.  (Note: While it may reduce exposure, it's not completely allergen-proof.)\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Affordability:**  Microfiber is generally a less expensive filling option compared to materials like down or feather.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that \"microfiber\" in this context refers specifically to the *filling material* itself, not the fabric covering the furniture. While the furniture might have a microfiber *cover*, the inner filling is made from those tiny polyester fibers.  The microfiber filling is often used in cushions, pillows, and other furniture components where softness and resilience are desired.\n",
